		<p>The installer currently has no write access to the file <i>dbconfig.php</i> in the <i>eventpublish</i> directory.</p>
		<p>If you are installing on a Unix server, simply chmod the file to 0666. You can do this through the command line or by using your FTP client. Right-click on the file, select properties and you will be able to set the permissions.</p>
		<p>If you are installing on Windows/IIS, please use the IIS console to make the file writable.</p>
